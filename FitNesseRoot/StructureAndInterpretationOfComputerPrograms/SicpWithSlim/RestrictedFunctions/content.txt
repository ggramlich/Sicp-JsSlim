You can define restrictions of a function by calling the restrict method which is defined in the
[[global setup][<StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.SetUp]].
In functional programming, this is often referred to as currying.

The method signature is restrict(func, position, value). The argument position count starts from 1.

|script                                 |
|define|cube|as|restrict(Math.pow, 2, 3)|
|check |cube|1 |1                       |
|check |cube|2 |8                       |
|check |cube|3 |27                      |
|check |cube|4 |64                      |

|script                                   |
|define|expTwo|as|restrict(Math.pow, 1, 2)|
|check |expTwo|0 |1                       |
|check |expTwo|1 |2                       |
|check |expTwo|2 |4                       |
