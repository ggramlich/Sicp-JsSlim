!1 Welcome to [[FitNesse][FitNesse.FitNesse]]!
!3 ''The fully integrated stand-alone acceptance testing framework and wiki.''

These test pages are my attempt to implement the algorithms described in the video lectures and the Book [[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms]] (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman in an acceptance test driven way.
I use the functional language that I know best: !-JavaScript-!. And it turns out that it is very easy to dynamically create new functions on the wiki pages, even though it is not easy to debug them.

To run the tests, put the fitnesse.jar and the jsSlim.jar in the folder that contains the !-FitNesseRoot-! and the fixtures folder, then start fitnesse from there with
{{{
java -jar fitnesse.jar -p 8070 -e 0
}}}
and browse to http://localhost:8070

The base suite is StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.

In StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.SicpWithSlim the basic functionality of the SICP test system is described.
